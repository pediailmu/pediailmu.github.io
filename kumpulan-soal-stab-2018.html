                                            the past, there was a king in South Sulawesi who had seven daughters. That said, if you have 7 children, one of them must be offered to the Giant Eagle so that the palace family is protected from disaster.
This made the king satisfied and decided to open a contest. Anyone who succeeds in conquering Rajawali, if he is a man, will be married to one of his daughters. If he is a woman, he will be appointed as a family member.
Therefore, many residents flocked to save the royal princess. However, no one managed to defeat Rajawali.
When the Giant Eagle was installed and released by the princess, there came a young man who saved him with a rope and badik. He also managed to stab and kill Rajawali. The princess finally survived and was able to return to the kingdom with relief and calm.
Unfortunately, the young man then left and did not come to ask for his salary. Therefore, the king was returned to find the conqueror of the Rajawali.
Therefore, there are many people who claim to have saved the princess. Agreeing, the princess still saved the face of the man who had saved her.
"Father! That's the young man who defeated the giant eagle! Exclaimed the Princess while pointing towards the young man in the middle of the race arena."
The King gasped in surprise, as if he did not believe what he was witnessing. Apparently, in addition to magic, young people are also very adept at playing soccer. The King was very impressed by the young man. After the young man came out of the race arena, the King departed the young man.
The king asked, "why did you not come to the kingdom, to collect the promise of your success in saving my child?" The boy replied, "I saved the princess not because of her gift, but the servant was sincere. Even if the king wants to marry us, I want everything based on the request of the princess. "
The princess also said if she had been liked by the man since the beginning of meeting. In the end, they live together and are happy forever.

They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday. One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!”They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!” “We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said. They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger. “Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy. Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said. become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip. Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits. “I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off.Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town. “There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.” At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace. “Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?” “Here I am, at your feet.” “Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?” “Please let me be your retainer.” “I wonder if your very small body can do anything.” “I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee. “Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.” “Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm. “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong. One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess.“Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi. Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer. “Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked. “Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry. “Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said. “Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wishthat I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!” And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</a>

                                            I have no doubt that some will read the byline of this editorial and conveniently turn off or tune out without considering an iota of the argument or rhetoric presented.  It isn't my country, they certainly are not my children, and whether this country implodes or soars to the heights of success makes little difference to me.
So what is the major malfunction of the Indonesian education system?    Does anyone seriously believe 'education' in  Indonesia is on par with the west, or even Asian countries like Japan, Korea or Singapore?  Ask the question another way: If you had to have spinal or brain surgery, would you prefer to have that surgery performed here in Jakarta, in Singapore or Hong Kong?  
If you answered 'here in Indonesia', I would presume you either have a very decently western-trained physician, or else no resources whatsoever.  Or at least, none of my Indonesian friends with any money has ever had major medical procedures performed here.  They very readily say they would rather fly to Singapore than trust an Indonesian doctor to open them up.  Which is all one needs to know when it comes to 'evidence'of the torturous state of Indonesian education.
Certainly we can take a good deal of time arguing about whose fault it is ' but the more immediate and pressing question ought to be why Indonesia has not followed in the footsteps of Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Japan.  
Rather than chasing red herrings that lead to nowhere, let us tackle the real problems plaguing the system. Better to kill the disease than merely react the symptoms, after all.
To all of this I am certain there will come shrill protests that my own country, America, is no shining example to follow.  Indeed, my country has created successive generations of people so devoid of morality that it is soon doomed to entropy in the same way that the Roman Empire did.  
But one fault is not remedied by pointing out another, and as much as it may please the senses, arguing about my country's shortcomings does nothing to address the issues that plague Indonesia's education system.
So what are the major issues here in Indonesia?  Let us look at a few.  
First, corruption: the graft and corruption that is Indonesia is almost unparalleled in scope, and its influence on the educational infrastructure of the country can not be overstated.  It is no mistake that diplomas being easily purchased and cash-laden envelopes greasing the wheels for degrees that have not been actually earned play a large part of the reasoning behind informed, well-off people in Indonesia traveling overseas to get medical attention.
Second, integrity (a close cousin of the whole 'corruption' thing).  There is none here.  The same person who smiles and assures you all is fine will 10 seconds later stab you in the back with no more than a flinch of a thought, if that.  
This general deficiency quite literally bleeds into the educational system in this country. You know, the whole idea of paying for scores related to the national exams (UN) administered, the additional concept (practiced regularly) of envelopes of cash exchanged with administrators or teachers that, magically (or not so magically) seem to correlate to above average marks for students who clearly can barely spell their own names, let alone count and reason higher-level arithmetic.
And thus we come back to the reason well-off Indonesians and expatriates travel overseas for serious medical treatment.
Does anyone see a pattern here?    That I managed to suck $40,000 plus out of your economy (in US$, by the way, not Rp) is just further evidence of where I was educated, and conversely where I was not educated.  Enough said.

THE LONELY LANDY
 One day, there was a porcupine named landy. He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him, because they afraid of his spikes.
“dear landy, we don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too sharp. We don’t want you to hurt us,” said cici the rabbit one day.
“cici is right, landy, it is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, landy, just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we are close to you.” Said tito the rooster.
Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank. “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”
Suddenly, kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to landy and said, “landy, what are you thinking of?”
“oh, nothing.” Landy replied.
“don’t lie to me, landy! Who knows I can help you.” Said kuku  wisely. Then he sat beside landy. He wasn’t afraid of landy’s spikes.
Shortly, landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said. “poor you, but it isn’t your fault. I know your spikes are very usefull and helpful for you. They will realize it someday, trust me!”
Thanks, kuku, you are my best friend.”
One day, koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including landy. But he decided not to com. He didn’t want to mess up the party.
“I’ll come with you landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless.” Said kuku, finally landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.
Suddenly tito screamed, “help…help…! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourself!” then, everyone saved their lives, except kuku and landy. Kuku pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And landy rolled his body into a ball.
Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched landy. Of course, the spikes pricked him. He screamed. “ouch!” since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase landy’s friend any longer. Then, he ran away.
“horray… horray…! Long live landy! He saved our lives.” Said cici and her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.</a>

They prayedto the gods for a child, even one as small as a finger, and (2)their prayers wereanswered. The child born to them was so small that they named him Issun Boshi, 'LittleOne Inch'. When Issun Boshi reached the age of 15, he said (3) to his parents andset out for Kyoto, the capital city, to seek his fortune.In Kyoto he found employment in a wealthy household. He could not do much workbecause of his size, but his (4) and sincerity pleased his master and his (5)And their daughter found him delightful.One day Issun Boshi accompanied the girl to the temple. On the way, two giantsleaped out in front of them from behind some bushes.Issun Boshi (6) drew their attention to him so that the girl could escape. Butthen the giants were furious with him and one of them picked him up and swallowed him.Issun Boshi had a needle his mother had given him. He used to wear it around hiswaist like a sword. When he found himself in the giant's stomach he took out the needlefrom its scabbard and began to stab the giant's stomach with it. Then climbing out throughthe gullet he stormed into the giant's mouth where he wreaked havoc with his needleThe giant was frightened and spat him out.When the other giant (7) to look at him, Issun Boshi stabbed him in the eyeThe giants had enough. They ran away, one holding a hand to his mouth and the other tohis eye.In their haste they left behind a mallet which Issun Boshi and the girl - she hadcome back to help him - (8) as a magical object"You have to hit it on the ground and make a wish," said the girlSo they hit the mallet on the ground and made a wish.

                                            tolong yg bisa menjawab soal tersebut tolong dibantu?.maaf kalo kurang jelas,adanya ky gituOnce upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday.One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!”They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said.They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger.“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy.Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits.“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off.Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town.“There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”“Here I am, at your feet.”“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”“Please let me be your retainer.”“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee.“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.”“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm. “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong.One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</a>

Andra : Um ... what is it? It looks like a fish. Laudya : Well, it's a stingray. It has a wide and flat body. Andra : Look! It has fins like a bird's wings. Laudya : It does.

                                            Landi and his spikesThere was a porcupine. He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him because they were afraid of his spikes.“Dear Landi. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are to sharp. We don’t want you to hurt us,” said Cici, the rabbit one day.“Cici is right, Landi. It is not because you are bad or rude to us, no, Landi! Just because of your spikes. They will stab us when we come close to you,” said Tito the rooster.Landi felt lonely. He murmured, “Why don’t they want to play with me?”Landi spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank. “I would have lots of friends and play with them if no spikes were on my body.I would be happy. I would not be lonely like this. What a shame!”Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landi and said, “Landi, what are you thinking of?”“Oh, nothing,” Landi replied.“Don’t lie to me, Landi. Please tell me your problem. Who knows I can help you,” Kuku said wisely. Then he sat beside Landi. He wasn’t afraid of Landi’s spikes.Shortly, Landi told Kuku his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor you. But it is not your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and helpful to you. Your friend will realize it some day. Trust me, Landi.”“Thanks, Kuku. You’re really my best friend. You are the only one here who wants to be my fellow.”One day, Sam the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including Landi. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to mess up the party.“I’ll come with you, Landi. I’ll tell everyone that you are harmless,” said Kuku. Finally, Landi attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.Suddenly, Tito ran here and there screaming, “Help … help …! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourselves!” Then everyone ran to save their lives, except Kuku and Landi. Kuku pulled his head and legs into his shell. Landi rolled his body into a ball.Unintentionally, the evil wolf stepped his foot on Landi. Of course, the spikes pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase Landi’s friends any longer. Then he ran away.“Horray … horray …! Long live Landi! He saved our lives, “said Cici and her friends. Everyone shook Landi’s hand and thanked him. From then on, Landi wasn’t lonely anymore.

                                            THE RED HILLMany years ago, wild swordfish filled the sea around Singapore. The people were very afraid of these fiercefish. They attacked the fisherman out at sea and scared people away from the beaches.Raja Iskandar, the ruler of Singapore, decided that something must be done 'kill the swordfish!' the Rajaordered his Soldiers.The soldiers tried to stab the fish with their sharp spears. But the swordfish defeated them. They killed andinjured many brave soldiers. The raja walked sadly back up the beach "what can I do to stop these dreadfulswordfish?" he exclaimed aloud."I have an idea," whispered a little voice. The Raja turned around and saw a young boy sitting on a rock."build a wall of banana stems in the water, " suggested the little boy "then, when the fish come in on the tide, thesharp swords will pierce the soft stems and they will be trapped." " what a good idea," the Raja Thought. So heordered his soldiers to cut down all the banana trees they could find. Then they built a long wall of banana stemsalong the beachAt high tide, the fish swam towards the shore and their swords stuck fast to the sticky stems of banana trees.The soldiers quickly kill the trapped fish. What a feast of fish the people had that day! No soldiers had died and noswordfish remained to frighten them. The people felt save and happy again.The Raja , however, felt uneasy. "that little is too clever," he told his Captain. I fear he will be morepowerful than me one day.The Captain thought the Raja wanted him to get rid of the boy. The next night, he ordered four men to kill thelittle boy. They crept up the hill to the boy's hut and kicked the door open.To their surprise, they found a strange old woman with long white hair there. The boy was nowhere to beseen. "you wicked men" she screamed. The boy helped you and yet you want to kill him. I will not let the worldforget how ungrateful you are! The terrified soldiers fled at once. Suddenly, a hole opened up in the ground beforethem! Thick red blood gushed from it and steamed down the hill after them. It stained the ground red. From that dayon the hill has been called Red Hill or Bukit Merah.​</a>

“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm.
 “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi. The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong.One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu  Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked. “Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi. The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</a>

                                            Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday. One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!” They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!” “We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said. They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger. “Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy. Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said. become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip. Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits. “I’m going now,” Issumboshi said. “Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off. Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body. … … … At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town. “There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.” At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace. “Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?” “Here I am, at your feet.” “Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?” “Please let me be your retainer.” “I wonder if your very small body can do anything.” “I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee. “Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.” “Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm. “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong. One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared.

                                            the past, there was a king in South Sulawesi who had seven daughters. That said, if you have 7 children, one of them must be offered to the Giant Eagle so that the palace family is protected from disaster.
This made the king satisfied and decided to open a contest. Anyone who succeeds in conquering Rajawali, if he is a man, will be married to one of his daughters. If he is a woman, he will be appointed as a family member.
Therefore, many residents flocked to save the royal princess. However, no one managed to defeat Rajawali.
When the Giant Eagle was installed and released by the princess, there came a young man who saved him with a rope and badik. He also managed to stab and kill Rajawali. The princess finally survived and was able to return to the kingdom with relief and calm.
Unfortunately, the young man then left and did not come to ask for his salary. Therefore, the king was returned to find the conqueror of the Rajawali.
Therefore, there are many people who claim to have saved the princess. Agreeing, the princess still saved the face of the man who had saved her.
"Father! That's the young man who defeated the giant eagle! Exclaimed the Princess while pointing towards the young man in the middle of the race arena."
The King gasped in surprise, as if he did not believe what he was witnessing. Apparently, in addition to magic, young people are also very adept at playing soccer. The King was very impressed by the young man. After the young man came out of the race arena, the King departed the young man.
The king asked, "why did you not come to the kingdom, to collect the promise of your success in saving my child?" The boy replied, "I saved the princess not because of her gift, but the servant was sincere. Even if the king wants to marry us, I want everything based on the request of the princess. "
The princess also said if she had been liked by the man since the beginning of meeting. In the end, they live together and are happy forever.

                            9. the past, there was a king in South Sulawesi who had seven daughters. That said, if you have 7 children, one of them must be offered to the Giant Eagle so that the palace family is protected from disaster.
This made the king satisfied and decided to open a contest. Anyone who succeeds in conquering Rajawali, if he is a man, will be married to one of his daughters. If he is a woman, he will be appointed as a family member.
Therefore, many residents flocked to save the royal princess. However, no one managed to defeat Rajawali.
When the Giant Eagle was installed and released by the princess, there came a young man who saved him with a rope and badik. He also managed to stab and kill Rajawali. The princess finally survived and was able to return to the kingdom with relief and calm.
Unfortunately, the young man then left and did not come to ask for his salary. Therefore, the king was returned to find the conqueror of the Rajawali.
Therefore, there are many people who claim to have saved the princess. Agreeing, the princess still saved the face of the man who had saved her.
"Father! That's the young man who defeated the giant eagle! Exclaimed the Princess while pointing towards the young man in the middle of the race arena."
The King gasped in surprise, as if he did not believe what he was witnessing. Apparently, in addition to magic, young people are also very adept at playing soccer. The King was very impressed by the young man. After the young man came out of the race arena, the King departed the young man.
The king asked, "why did you not come to the kingdom, to collect the promise of your success in saving my child?" The boy replied, "I saved the princess not because of her gift, but the servant was sincere. Even if the king wants to marry us, I want everything based on the request of the princess. "
The princess also said if she had been liked by the man since the beginning of meeting. In the end, they live together and are happy forever.

                            10. tolong bantuin isi ya.. ini teks nya..Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday. One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!”They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!” “We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said. They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger. “Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy. Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said. become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip. Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits. “I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off.Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town. “There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.” At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace. “Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?” “Here I am, at your feet.” “Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?” “Please let me be your retainer.” “I wonder if your very small body can do anything.” “I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee. “Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.” “Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm. “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong. One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess.“Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi. Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer. “Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked. “Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry. “Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said. “Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wishthat I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!” And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</h2><br />

                            12. I have no doubt that some will read the byline of this editorial and conveniently turn off or tune out without considering an iota of the argument or rhetoric presented.  It isn't my country, they certainly are not my children, and whether this country implodes or soars to the heights of success makes little difference to me.
So what is the major malfunction of the Indonesian education system?    Does anyone seriously believe 'education' in  Indonesia is on par with the west, or even Asian countries like Japan, Korea or Singapore?  Ask the question another way: If you had to have spinal or brain surgery, would you prefer to have that surgery performed here in Jakarta, in Singapore or Hong Kong?  
If you answered 'here in Indonesia', I would presume you either have a very decently western-trained physician, or else no resources whatsoever.  Or at least, none of my Indonesian friends with any money has ever had major medical procedures performed here.  They very readily say they would rather fly to Singapore than trust an Indonesian doctor to open them up.  Which is all one needs to know when it comes to 'evidence'of the torturous state of Indonesian education.
Certainly we can take a good deal of time arguing about whose fault it is ' but the more immediate and pressing question ought to be why Indonesia has not followed in the footsteps of Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Japan.  
Rather than chasing red herrings that lead to nowhere, let us tackle the real problems plaguing the system. Better to kill the disease than merely react the symptoms, after all.
To all of this I am certain there will come shrill protests that my own country, America, is no shining example to follow.  Indeed, my country has created successive generations of people so devoid of morality that it is soon doomed to entropy in the same way that the Roman Empire did.  
But one fault is not remedied by pointing out another, and as much as it may please the senses, arguing about my country's shortcomings does nothing to address the issues that plague Indonesia's education system.
So what are the major issues here in Indonesia?  Let us look at a few.  
First, corruption: the graft and corruption that is Indonesia is almost unparalleled in scope, and its influence on the educational infrastructure of the country can not be overstated.  It is no mistake that diplomas being easily purchased and cash-laden envelopes greasing the wheels for degrees that have not been actually earned play a large part of the reasoning behind informed, well-off people in Indonesia traveling overseas to get medical attention.
Second, integrity (a close cousin of the whole 'corruption' thing).  There is none here.  The same person who smiles and assures you all is fine will 10 seconds later stab you in the back with no more than a flinch of a thought, if that.  
This general deficiency quite literally bleeds into the educational system in this country. You know, the whole idea of paying for scores related to the national exams (UN) administered, the additional concept (practiced regularly) of envelopes of cash exchanged with administrators or teachers that, magically (or not so magically) seem to correlate to above average marks for students who clearly can barely spell their own names, let alone count and reason higher-level arithmetic.
And thus we come back to the reason well-off Indonesians and expatriates travel overseas for serious medical treatment.
Does anyone see a pattern here?    That I managed to suck $40,000 plus out of your economy (in US$, by the way, not Rp) is just further evidence of where I was educated, and conversely where I was not educated.  Enough said.

     One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits.“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off. Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town.
“There is a ne palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”
At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.” The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”“Here I am, at your feet.”“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”“Please let me be your retainer.”“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi  yelled, stabbing the bee.“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.” 
“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm.
 “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi. The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong.One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu  Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked. “Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi. The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</h2><br />

THE LONELY LANDY
 One day, there was a porcupine named landy. He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him, because they afraid of his spikes.
“dear landy, we don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too sharp. We don’t want you to hurt us,” said cici the rabbit one day.
“cici is right, landy, it is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, landy, just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we are close to you.” Said tito the rooster.
Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank. “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”
Suddenly, kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to landy and said, “landy, what are you thinking of?”
“oh, nothing.” Landy replied.
“don’t lie to me, landy! Who knows I can help you.” Said kuku  wisely. Then he sat beside landy. He wasn’t afraid of landy’s spikes.
Shortly, landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said. “poor you, but it isn’t your fault. I know your spikes are very usefull and helpful for you. They will realize it someday, trust me!”
Thanks, kuku, you are my best friend.”
One day, koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including landy. But he decided not to com. He didn’t want to mess up the party.
“I’ll come with you landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless.” Said kuku, finally landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.
Suddenly tito screamed, “help…help…! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourself!” then, everyone saved their lives, except kuku and landy. Kuku pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And landy rolled his body into a ball.
Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched landy. Of course, the spikes pricked him. He screamed. “ouch!” since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase landy’s friend any longer. Then, he ran away.
“horray… horray…! Long live landy! He saved our lives.” Said cici and her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.</h2><br />
                        why does kuku is not afraid with landy?<br />how could kuku not being stab by landy's spike?<br /><br />Why was the evil wolf's foot start bleeding?<br />

                            28. tolong yg bisa menjawab soal tersebut tolong dibantu?.maaf kalo kurang jelas,adanya ky gituOnce upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday.One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!”They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said.They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger.“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy.Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits.“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off.Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town.“There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”“Here I am, at your feet.”“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”“Please let me be your retainer.”“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee.“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.”“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm. “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong.One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</h2><br />

                            33. Landi and his spikesThere was a porcupine. He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him because they were afraid of his spikes.“Dear Landi. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are to sharp. We don’t want you to hurt us,” said Cici, the rabbit one day.“Cici is right, Landi. It is not because you are bad or rude to us, no, Landi! Just because of your spikes. They will stab us when we come close to you,” said Tito the rooster.Landi felt lonely. He murmured, “Why don’t they want to play with me?”Landi spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank. “I would have lots of friends and play with them if no spikes were on my body.I would be happy. I would not be lonely like this. What a shame!”Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landi and said, “Landi, what are you thinking of?”“Oh, nothing,” Landi replied.“Don’t lie to me, Landi. Please tell me your problem. Who knows I can help you,” Kuku said wisely. Then he sat beside Landi. He wasn’t afraid of Landi’s spikes.Shortly, Landi told Kuku his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor you. But it is not your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and helpful to you. Your friend will realize it some day. Trust me, Landi.”“Thanks, Kuku. You’re really my best friend. You are the only one here who wants to be my fellow.”One day, Sam the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including Landi. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to mess up the party.“I’ll come with you, Landi. I’ll tell everyone that you are harmless,” said Kuku. Finally, Landi attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.Suddenly, Tito ran here and there screaming, “Help … help …! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourselves!” Then everyone ran to save their lives, except Kuku and Landi. Kuku pulled his head and legs into his shell. Landi rolled his body into a ball.Unintentionally, the evil wolf stepped his foot on Landi. Of course, the spikes pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase Landi’s friends any longer. Then he ran away.“Horray … horray …! Long live Landi! He saved our lives, “said Cici and her friends. Everyone shook Landi’s hand and thanked him. From then on, Landi wasn’t lonely anymore. His friends knew that his spikes would not hurt anyone, unless they wanted to hurt Landi.(1)what is the title of the story?(2)what do you think to be the main character of the story?(3)what is the orientation of the story?(4)what was Landi?(5)why did Landi have no friends?(6)what is the complication of the story?(7)what did Landi do in the riverbank?(8)what was Kuku?(9)what did Kuku tells to Landi?(10)why did everyone run and hide to save their lives at Sam's party?(11)why did Landi and Kuku do when the wolf came?(12)what is the resolution of the story?(13)what did other animals do then in the end?(14)what is the reorientation of the story?(15)what can you learn from the story?​ngasal???auto report!</h2><br />

They attacked the fisherman out at sea and scared people away from the beaches.Raja Iskandar, the ruler of Singapore, decided that something must be done 'kill the swordfish!' the Rajaordered his Soldiers.The soldiers tried to stab the fish with their sharp spears. But the swordfish defeated them. They killed andinjured many brave soldiers. The raja walked sadly back up the beach "what can I do to stop these dreadfulswordfish?" he exclaimed aloud."I have an idea," whispered a little voice. The Raja turned around and saw a young boy sitting on a rock."build a wall of banana stems in the water, " suggested the little boy "then, when the fish come in on the tide, thesharp swords will pierce the soft stems and they will be trapped." " what a good idea," the Raja Thought. So heordered his soldiers to cut down all the banana trees they could find. Then they built a long wall of banana stemsalong the beachAt high tide, the fish swam towards the shore and their swords stuck fast to the sticky stems of banana trees.The soldiers quickly kill the trapped fish. What a feast of fish the people had that day! No soldiers had died and noswordfish remained to frighten them. The people felt save and happy again.The Raja , however, felt uneasy. "that little is too clever," he told his Captain. I fear he will be morepowerful than me one day.The Captain thought the Raja wanted him to get rid of the boy. The next night, he ordered four men to kill thelittle boy. They crept up the hill to the boy's hut and kicked the door open.To their surprise, they found a strange old woman with long white hair there. The boy was nowhere to beseen. "you wicked men" she screamed. The boy helped you and yet you want to kill him. I will not let the worldforget how ungrateful you are! The terrified soldiers fled at once. Suddenly, a hole opened up in the ground beforethem! Thick red blood gushed from it and steamed down the hill after them. It stained the ground red. From that dayon the hill has been called Red Hill or Bukit Merah.​</h2><br />

                            39. Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday. One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!” They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!” “We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said. They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger. “Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy. Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said. become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip. Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits. “I’m going now,” Issumboshi said. “Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off. Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body. … … … At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town. “There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.” At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace. “Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?” “Here I am, at your feet.” “Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?” “Please let me be your retainer.” “I wonder if your very small body can do anything.” “I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee. “Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.” “Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm. “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong. One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared.

"Saya ingin menjadi pelayan Tuan." "Saya ragu apakah tubuhmu yang sangat kecil memungkinkanmu melakukan tugas itu." "Saya akan tinggal di saku Tuan dan menjaga Tuan dari bahaya."</p><p></p><p>Ketika Issumboshi berkata demikian, seekor lebah terbang mendekati mereka. "Yhaa!"

                            40. the past, there was a king in South Sulawesi who had seven daughters. That said, if you have 7 children, one of them must be offered to the Giant Eagle so that the palace family is protected from disaster.
This made the king satisfied and decided to open a contest. Anyone who succeeds in conquering Rajawali, if he is a man, will be married to one of his daughters. If he is a woman, he will be appointed as a family member.
Therefore, many residents flocked to save the royal princess. However, no one managed to defeat Rajawali.
When the Giant Eagle was installed and released by the princess, there came a young man who saved him with a rope and badik. He also managed to stab and kill Rajawali. The princess finally survived and was able to return to the kingdom with relief and calm.
Unfortunately, the young man then left and did not come to ask for his salary. Therefore, the king was returned to find the conqueror of the Rajawali.
Therefore, there are many people who claim to have saved the princess. Agreeing, the princess still saved the face of the man who had saved her.
"Father! That's the young man who defeated the giant eagle! Exclaimed the Princess while pointing towards the young man in the middle of the race arena."
The King gasped in surprise, as if he did not believe what he was witnessing. Apparently, in addition to magic, young people are also very adept at playing soccer. The King was very impressed by the young man. After the young man came out of the race arena, the King departed the young man.
The king asked, "why did you not come to the kingdom, to collect the promise of your success in saving my child?" The boy replied, "I saved the princess not because of her gift, but the servant was sincere. Even if the king wants to marry us, I want everything based on the request of the princess. "
The princess also said if she had been liked by the man since the beginning of meeting. In the end, they live together and are happy forever.

                        <p>Di masa lalu, ada seorang raja di Sulawesi Selatan yang memiliki tujuh anak perempuan. Yang mengatakan, jika Anda memiliki 7 anak, salah satu dari mereka harus ditawarkan kepada Elang Raksasa sehingga keluarga istana dilindungi dari bencana.</p><p>Ini membuat raja puas dan memutuskan untuk membuka kontes. Siapa pun yang berhasil menaklukkan Rajawali, jika ia seorang lelaki, akan menikah dengan salah satu putrinya. Jika dia seorang wanita, dia akan ditunjuk sebagai anggota keluarga.</p><p>Karena itu, banyak warga berbondong-bondong menyelamatkan putri kerajaan. Namun, tidak ada yang berhasil mengalahkan Rajawali.</p><p>Ketika Elang Raksasa dipasang dan dibebaskan oleh sang putri, datanglah seorang pria muda yang menyelamatkannya dengan tali dan badik. Dia juga berhasil menusuk dan membunuh Rajawali. Sang putri akhirnya selamat dan bisa kembali ke kerajaan dengan lega dan tenang.</p><p>Sayangnya, pemuda itu kemudian pergi dan tidak datang untuk meminta gajinya. Karena itu, raja dikembalikan untuk menemukan penakluk Rajawali.</p><p>Karena itu, ada banyak orang yang mengaku telah menyelamatkan sang putri. Setuju, sang putri masih menyelamatkan wajah pria yang telah menyelamatkannya.</p><p>"Ayah! Itu pemuda yang mengalahkan elang raksasa! Seru sang Putri sambil menunjuk ke arah pemuda di tengah arena lomba."</p><p>Raja tersentak kaget, seolah-olah dia tidak percaya apa yang dia saksikan. Ternyata, selain sihir, anak muda juga sangat mahir bermain sepakbola. Raja sangat terkesan oleh pemuda itu. Setelah pemuda itu keluar dari arena perlombaan, Raja meninggalkan pemuda itu.</p><p>Raja bertanya, "mengapa kamu tidak datang ke kerajaan, untuk mengumpulkan janji kesuksesan kamu dalam menyelamatkan anak saya?" Bocah itu menjawab, "Aku menyelamatkan sang putri bukan karena hadiahnya, tetapi pelayan itu tulus. Bahkan jika raja ingin menikahi kami, aku menginginkan segalanya berdasarkan permintaan sang putri."</p><p>Sang putri juga mengatakan jika dia disukai oleh lelaki itu sejak awal pertemuan. Pada akhirnya, mereka hidup bersama dan bahagia selamanya.</p><p></p><p>Orientasi, evaluasi, komplikasi, resolusi, nilai moral nya apa?</p><br />
